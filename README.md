# react-wallet-hooks

This repository contains a hand-made wrapper of the library [Web3Modal](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal), but for `React`.

It doesn't work very well and it shouldn't be used, especially because there are [wonderful projects](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) out there that does what I aimed to achieve, but it helped me to understand how `hooks` and `providers` work.
